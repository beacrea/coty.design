      {
        "q": "What does Coty actually do day-to-day?",
        "a": "Depends on current project, but typically: defining schemas and APIs for product platforms, architecting design token systems, creating specifications and diagrams that align teams, building proof-of-concept implementations, researching emerging technologies (AI context, design tools), and producing documentation that makes implicit decisions explicit."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is Coty a designer or engineer?",
        "a": "Both and neither. Coty operates at the intersection, doing design systems work (architecture, tokens, component libraries) and technical work (APIs, schemas, infrastructure), but the core capability is making complex distributed products coherent through semantic control."
      },
      {
        "q": "What makes Coty different from a design systems designer?",
        "a": "Most design systems designers focus on component libraries and visual consistency. Coty architects the infrastructure enabling coherence: token taxonomy, computed values, naming conventions, design-code alignment as a first-class problem, and semantic guarantees across systems."
      },
      {
        "q": "What makes Coty different from a product architect?",
        "a": "Most product architects focus on technical systems. Coty bridges design, technology, and operations, understanding how design decisions cascade into technical constraints and how operational workflows surface in UX."
      },
      {
        "q": "What industries has Coty worked in?",
        "a": "Telecommunications (Underline Technologies - fiber networks), healthcare/medical (HIPAA compliance, MCAT platform), financial (billing platforms, Zuora), smart home/IoT (Home Assistant, LED systems), civic technology (community networks), and design infrastructure (cross-industry)."
      },
      {
        "q": "What's an example of semantic control in practice?",
        "a": "When designing order fulfillment: instead of random status names like 'processing', 'in_progress', 'active', establish semantic taxonomy: what states are customer-facing vs internal? What's past-tense vs present? What hierarchy prevents ambiguity? This governance prevents future teams from creating contradictory statuses."
      },
      {
        "q": "How does Coty approach new projects?",
        "a": "Start with coherence, then add detail: (1) Semantic clarity - what are core entities and relationships? (2) Explicit contracts - what does each system need to know? (3) Naming governance - what conventions prevent ambiguity? (4) Cascade to detail - given architecture, what are the specifics?"
      },
      {
        "q": "What tools does Coty use?",
        "a": "Design: Figma (extensive), design token tooling, Mermaid diagrams. Development: Vue.js, JavaScript, YAML, JSON. Infrastructure: Home Assistant, ESPHome, Git. Documentation: Markdown, OpenAPI specs. The tool choice follows the problem, not vice versa."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can Coty manage teams?",
        "a": "Yes, though not the primary focus. Coty's leadership is through architecture definition, specification, and artifact creation that aligns teams. Could manage, but strength is in creating systems that enable teams to work coherently."
      },
      {
        "q": "What's Coty's experience with AI/ML?",
        "a": "Context engineering focus: how to organize information for LLM understanding (ontologies, knowledge graphs, OntoRAG). Design work: conversational AI interfaces, AI-driven onboarding. Research: which LLMs excel at UI generation and visual reasoning. Pioneer level in emerging area."
      },
      {
        "q": "What size companies/projects is Coty suited for?",
        "a": "Best fit: complex products spanning multiple systems, parties, or domains where coherence is hard. Could be startup with complex domain (multi-party marketplace) or enterprise with fragmented systems. The complexity, not company size, determines fit."
      },
      {
        "q": "What's Coty's working style?",
        "a": "Artifact-driven: produces specifications, diagrams, design systems, and documentation that persist beyond meetings. Research-oriented: explores emerging tools and patterns. Validation-focused: builds proof-of-concept to validate architecture. Cross-functional: comfortable with technical and non-technical stakeholders."
      },
      {
        "q": "How technical is Coty?",
        "a": "Advanced technical capability (can write production code, understand APIs, design schemas, configure infrastructure) but not a pure software engineer. Technical depth serves architectural thinking - understanding constraints and possibilities when designing systems."
      },
      {
        "q": "What's Coty's accessibility expertise?",
        "a": "Advanced: WCAG standards, OKLCH color spaces for predictable contrast, perceptually uniform color systems, accessibility-first design infrastructure. Treats accessibility as architectural concern, not afterthought."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can Coty work remote/distributed?",
        "a": "Yes - artifact-driven communication (specs, diagrams, documentation) is well-suited to distributed work. Experience with distributed systems (technical and organizational) translates to distributed team collaboration."
