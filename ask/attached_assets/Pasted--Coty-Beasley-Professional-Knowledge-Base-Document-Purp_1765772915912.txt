# Coty Beasley - Professional Knowledge Base

## Document Purpose
This structured knowledge document enables AI agents to understand and interact with information about Coty Beasley's professional identity, skills, experience, and capabilities. It is designed to be queryable, comprehensive, and accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.

## Quick Reference

**Name:** Coty Beasley  
**Role:** Architect-Operator: Distributed Product Systems Coherence  
**Website:** coty.design  
**Company Founded:** Underline Technologies (open-access fiber network platform)

**One-Sentence Summary:**  
I architect product coherence across visual design, technical platforms, and operational workflows by defining canonical rules, schemas, and interface specifications that prevent complex multi-party systems from fracturing into contradiction.

**Core Capability:** Semantic control - making implicit organizational knowledge explicit through infrastructure, specifications, and design systems

**Key Differentiator:** Bridges design, engineering, and product domains that most organizations silo, operating as architect-operator who defines, builds, and validates systems
