# Coty.Design
This repository is the main codebase for [coty.design](https://coty.design), my personal web app.

I've created subfolders in this repo to contain different applications.

- `/ask` - Chatbot that gives interactive details about my work and what I do, live at [ask.coty.design](https://ask.coty.design)
- `/blog` - Static blog content built with [Harp.js](http://harpjs.com), live at [coty.blog](https://coty.blog)
- `/main` - The main site at [coty.design](https://coty.design)
- `/labs` - An experimental sandbox for various projects
