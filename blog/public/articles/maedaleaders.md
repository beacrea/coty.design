# Context

**TL;DR** - [John Maeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maeda) said design wasn't that important in business after spending years advocating for design-led outcomes. I've added a response by [Mike Monteiro](https://muledesign.com/speaking/mike-monteiro) , another prominent voice in the design community and the co-founder of Mule Design.

# My Thoughts

I've included Mike's response because it's fairly close to my own. In recent years he's had some solid discourse on elevating the state of design instead of relegating it by shrinking responsibilities back toward traditional origins. 

To me, Maeda has been too close to the art part of design like the AIGA camps and evolutions from traditional graphic design. Now he's realizing that a narrow view through that lens isn't a great way to run companies.

I agree with that, but that's a failure to set the expectations of a fully realized designer - the Rams of the world, rather than the Rands.

I'm clearly biased, but generalist designers with engineering competencies is what the model should be for the real problems we're tackling today and in the future with regard to technology.

We've failed to create that industry in education and it's one of the main reasons I left formal schooling to pursue my own path.

Ultimately, design should be at the helm as a balance between business, engineering, and experience and well-versed in ethics and resiliency.

To say "Lol, I guess we're just pretty-makers, let's step back" denies the world of the curators and arbiters designers should become and ultimately the outcomes we need to achieve in business and society.
