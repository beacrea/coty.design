# Coty Beasley's Blog
This is a static blog project built with [Harp.js](http://harpjs.com/) , a simple static web with fantastic pre-processing support such as [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) , and [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/).

For my purposes, I want the purest content engine possible with HTML and CSS. Harp allows me to use the basics, but still have some of the management tools on top of the process.

As this project grows, I hope to add more features such as [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention). Ultimately, this project is an excercise in creating a self-hosted, self-maintained content platform for myself where I can share my thoughts and musings.
