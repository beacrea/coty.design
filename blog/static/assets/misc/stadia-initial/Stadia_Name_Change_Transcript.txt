Thanks for contacting us! My name is Lawrence. I'm happy to answer any questions you have about Stadia.

Lawrence

Hello there! am I speaking with Coty?

Coty Beasley
7:46 PM
I'm here, yes

Lawrence
7:47 PM
Hi Coty, how are you doing?

Coty Beasley
7:47 PM
I'm doing well, thanks

Lawrence
7:47 PM
That's good to know.

Lawrence
7:47 PM
I do see here that you wanted to change the capitalization of your name?

Coty Beasley
7:48 PM
Thats correct

Lawrence
7:48 PM
Alright Coty. I can definitely assist you with that request.

Lawrence
7:50 PM
Please stay in the chat and I'll go ahead and pull up your Stadia account.

Lawrence
7:51 PM
Coty, I do have your account here. Can you provide us the updated name?

Coty Beasley
7:52 PM
Coty

Lawrence
7:52 PM
Alright.

Lawrence
7:54 PM
Coty, upon checking it seems that "Coty" has already been taken.

Coty Beasley
7:55 PM
That is unfortunate. I feel your system will have a lot of issues downstream by having two people with the same namespace.

Coty Beasley
7:56 PM
That a Coty and a coty exists seems like a problem.

Lawrence
7:56 PM
To be Coty, what we can do right now is update your name to different one first.

Lawrence
7:56 PM
And re-update it to "Coty"

Lawrence
7:57 PM
To be clear, the name coty regardless of capitalization is yours.

Coty Beasley
7:57 PM
Ahh, then how is the capital version "taken"?

Lawrence
7:58 PM
You have it actually.

Lawrence
7:58 PM
In general. you have the name coty in the system regardless the capitalization.

Lawrence
7:58 PM
So if other players try to get Coty, they can't.

Coty Beasley
7:58 PM
If I switch names in the interim, will I have claim to my past ones?

Lawrence
7:59 PM
It is possible. Would like to give it a try?

Coty Beasley
7:59 PM
Yeah, lets try

Lawrence
7:59 PM
What name do you have in mind other than Coty. or coty.

Coty Beasley
8:00 PM
Beasley

Lawrence
8:00 PM
Alright after that, I'll go ahead and change it to Coty. OK?

Coty Beasley
8:00 PM
Ok

Lawrence
8:00 PM
Got you. Please wait for a moment.

Lawrence
8:01 PM
Beasley is currently taken. Do you have other names in mind?

Coty Beasley
8:01 PM
Let's go for something obscure then. Beasles247

Lawrence
8:01 PM
Alright.

Lawrence
8:04 PM
I hate to be the bearer of bad news Coty. But it seems that there is someone who already claimed that name.

Lawrence
8:04 PM
But I was still able to change it back to just "coty"

Coty Beasley
8:04 PM
I'll autogenerate one then

Lawrence
8:05 PM
What do you mean?

Coty Beasley
8:05 PM
MakerAPsArIcYaRt

Coty Beasley
8:05 PM
I'd suspect that won't be taken

Lawrence
8:05 PM
No what I meant to say was, I was able to change the name to Beasles247

Lawrence
8:05 PM
And tried to change your name to Coty right away.

Lawrence
8:06 PM
But the thing is, Coty is already taken.

Lawrence
8:06 PM
so instead of Beasles247, I went ahead and changed it back to coty.

Coty Beasley
8:07 PM
Ok, so is the theory that I own both Coty and coty inaccurate or is the system current not equipped to handle this request and I do "own" both versions?

Lawrence
8:07 PM
This was an issue before, but our developers seems to have addressed and updated this issue.

Lawrence
8:07 PM
And I believe the Stadia naming system is now Case Sensitive.

Lawrence
8:08 PM
So both "Coty" and "coty" are different.

Coty Beasley
8:09 PM
That seems like a bad idea from a development architecture standpoint.

Coty Beasley
8:10 PM
Anyway, I suppose that's the only option right now.

Lawrence
8:10 PM
My apologies Coty.

Lawrence
8:10 PM
Do you have other names in mind?

Coty Beasley
8:11 PM
I'll stick with what I have.

Coty Beasley
8:11 PM
Thanks though.

Lawrence
8:11 PM
Alright. Thank you for your patience Coty. Appreciate it.

Lawrence
8:11 PM
Will there be anything else that you want to clarify before I let you go?

Coty Beasley
8:11 PM
That'll be it, thanks.

Lawrence
