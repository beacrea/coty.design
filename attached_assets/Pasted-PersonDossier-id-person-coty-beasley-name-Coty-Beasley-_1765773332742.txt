    Professional profile for Q&A about skills, roles, experience, operating style, domains, and artifacts; optimize for retrieval and agent reasoning.

  executive_summary
    Coty operates at the intersection of distributed product architecture, design infrastructure, and operational systems engineering, architecting product coherence across visual design, technical platforms, and operational workflows.
    Distinct capability: semantic control—defining canonical rules, schemas, contracts, and interface specifications that prevent complex multi-party products from fracturing into contradiction.
    Identity: architect-operator—defines system shape, communicates the rules, and validates they work in practice through hands-on work and implementation-aware design.

  identity
    primary_archetype Architect-Operator
    differentiators[6]
      Semantic control (canonical meaning, naming, contracts)
      Cross-domain coherence (UX + API + ops + infra)
      Infrastructure-first design systems (tokens as contracts)
      Workflow semantics and distributed responsibility clarity
      Specs/diagrams as governance artifacts
      Emerging-tech pioneering (AI context, tokens, IoT)

    simultaneous_modes[6]
      Design systems architect (foundational infrastructure)
      Product architect (multi-system coherence)
      Context engineer (how AI understands information)
      Technical communicator (alignment via artifacts)
      Pioneer of emerging technologies in domain
      Entrepreneur/infrastructure builder (telecom + civic networks)

    role_fit_notes
      Not primarily a people manager (though capable); not a pure IC-only contributor (though hands-on); not strategist-only (though sets direction).
      Operates as architect-operator: defines architecture, encodes governance, ensures practical viability.

  core_responsibilities
    design_systems_architecture_infrastructure
      scope
        Architect foundational infrastructure enabling coherent UX at scale; treat design systems as infrastructural systems, not just component libraries.
      design_token_architecture
        activities[6]
          Research token editors supporting computed values and intelligent operations (e.g., contrast-maximizing color selection, algorithmic variations).
          Structure token taxonomy (brand attributes, visual foundations, semantic tokens) aligned to DTCG-style specification principles.
          Build dark/light mode strategy using Figma variables and modes; focus on transformation rules across contexts.
          Create token categories (fill, text, outline, elevation, motion) with explicit relationships and constraints.
          Design naming conventions to prevent entropy and communicate intent to designers and engineers.
          Treat tokens as contracts linking design intent to implementation reality.
      implementation_design_alignment
        activities[5]
          Tie design libraries to component libraries/Storybook to reduce drift.
          Define component schemas with explicit typography references, spacing relationships, and sizing rules.
          Treat design-code alignment as a first-class architectural problem.
          Build infrastructure that makes synchronization economical and sustainable.
          Ensure teams trust rules by making governance explicit and usable.
      design_infrastructure_pioneering
        activities[4]
          Explore token-authoring solutions beyond Tokens Studio (computed values, graph automation, intelligent operations).
          Research how to enable design at scale without maintenance burden.
          Apply systems thinking: understand cascade effects of token decisions.
          Build governance patterns that remain stable as organizations grow.
      why_it_matters
        Design systems fail at scale when treated as libraries; succeed when treated as governed infrastructure with trusted contracts and maintainable semantics.

    product_architecture_multi_system_coherence
      scope
        Define conceptual and technical shape of complex products spanning UX, APIs, data, and operational workflows; make products coherent under multi-team and multi-party reality.

      api_as_product_architecture
        activities[7]
          Define requirements where API is the product (not an implementation detail).
          Design schema exploration and discovery interfaces for large conceptual spaces.
          Build versioning strategies balancing backward compatibility with evolution.
          Create sandbox environments for safe experimentation and partner testing.
          Distinguish internal vs external APIs with differing governance requirements.
          Produce OpenAPI specifications as canonical contracts.
          Author structured YAML object models (e.g., Invoice, InvoiceItem, enums, status flows).

        core_view
          API quality is primarily semantic and schema-driven: clarity of mental model, consistency under edge cases, and coherent contracts over time.

      multi_party_workflow_orchestration
        activities[6]
          Design voice service order fulfillment workflows with explicit state semantics.
          Define cross-party handoffs and expectations (subscriber, Underline, provider).
          Specify responsibility at each stage to avoid ambiguous failure modes.
          Build components and status systems that reflect distributed work reality.
          Iterate heavily on event naming conventions (hierarchy, tense, separators, simplification rules).
          Use aggregation rules for customer-facing status vs internal detail.

        example_thinking_pattern
          Use taxonomy: past-tense for completed events, present-tense for state; hierarchical naming to avoid ambiguity; naming is governance.

      operational_platform_semantics
        support_routing_and_traceability
          activities[3]
            Design support routing frameworks distinguishing internal handling vs provider escalation.
            Maintain historical traceability across channels/systems so requests do not get lost.
            Treat support semantics as product surface, not back-office noise.
        billing_migration_and_semantics
          activities[8]
            Treat billing migration (Zuora) as product work, not an ops chore.
            Design invoice status mapping semantics and filtering constraints.
            Create calculated statuses (e.g., autopaid logic) bridging stored truth and customer-comprehensible truth.
            Work with Zuora objects/tables (e.g., ProductRatePlanCharge, tier tables).
            Define import field mappings, accounting code IDs, and data model alignment.
            Ensure billing UI semantics match underlying financial realities without confusing customers.
            Build semantics that support operations, finance, and customer support.
            Encode governance so future changes don’t fracture meaning.
        why_it_matters
          Operational platforms fail when semantics are hidden; coherence requires explicit, user-meaningful contracts that reconcile system truth with human understanding.

      internal_tools_as_product
        activities[6]
          Drive redesign of internal operations tool for multi-market and external partner use.
          Define navigation groupings and admin structures that scale with domain complexity.
          Name entities carefully (avoid conflating user vs account, etc.).
          Treat multi-market scaling as architecture (not just additional fields).
          Ensure permissions/admin surfaces map to real responsibilities.
          Make complexity navigable through clear information architecture.
        why_it_matters
          Internal tool clarity reduces operational risk; ambiguity in ops tooling propagates into customer experience and partner reliability.

    context_engineering_information_architecture

          Investigate knowledge graphs and OntologyRAG/OntoRAG approaches.
          Define entity types, relationships, hierarchies, constraints, and exceptions.
          Aim for reasoning over domain models, not mere keyword matching.
          Design context flow: user needs → retrieval structure → coherent answer/action.

      project_registry_and_templates
        activities[5]
          Create project template structures and bootstrap workflows.
          Use ADRs and documentation patterns to preserve decision history.

          Design recommendation discovery structures (what to retrieve for each user).
          Build human-AI collaboration patterns that feel natural.

      why_it_matters
        As organizations and AI usage scale, the limiting factor becomes context structure; explicit models enable coherent retrieval and trustworthy reasoning.

    technical_communication_specification

          Capture requirements with semantic precision and enforceable language.
          Use specs as pre-work governance, not post-hoc documentation.
        why_it_matters
          Well-written specs prevent ambiguity that otherwise becomes bugs, missed requirements, and partner friction.

      diagram_visual_architecture
        activities[5]
          Use Mermaid to model workflows and system interactions.
          Create entity-relationship diagrams to reveal structural problems.
          Build visual narratives for technical and non-technical audiences.
          Prefer drawing the system as a test of clarity; if it can’t be drawn, it isn’t clear.
          Use diagrams as persistent architecture artifacts.

      presentation_mixed_audiences
        activities[5]
          Structure presentations for both technical and business stakeholders.

  working_process_approach
    architectural_thinking_pattern
      rule
        Start with coherence, then add detail.
      steps[4]
        Semantic clarity (entities, relationships, meanings of status/state/party)
        Explicit contracts (interfaces, boundaries, responsibilities)
        Naming governance (conventions preventing ambiguity and drift)
        Cascade to detail (UI, tokens, workflows, implementation checks)

      example_voice_service_order_fulfillment
