**Scope:** `/portfolio`  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Added:** 2024-12-28

**Description:**  
Create an interactive visualization showing the evolution of coty.design across major versions (eras). Should allow users to explore design philosophy changes, key decisions, and visual language evolution over time.

**Requirements:**
- Opt-in experience (hidden by default, revealed for interested peers)
- Uses data from `/docs/eras/*.md` files
- Visual representation of timeline with era cards
- Accessible and keyboard-navigable

**Notes:**
- Target audience: technical peers and design practitioners, not general visitors
