# Design Era Records (DERs)

This directory contains **Design Era Records** — structured documentation of the design philosophy, strategy, and key decisions for each major version of coty.design.

## What is a DER?

A DER is like an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) but focused on design philosophy and strategy rather than technical implementation. Each major version of the site represents a distinct "era" with its own goals, visual language, and approach to solving the core problem of professional presentation.

## Why Document Design Eras?

1. **Institutional memory** — Capture the *why* behind design choices before it's forgotten
2. **Evolution tracking** — See how thinking has evolved across versions
3. **Reflection** — Revisit past decisions to learn what worked and what didn't
4. **Communication** — Share design philosophy with collaborators and peers
5. **Portfolio meta-layer** — The eras themselves demonstrate problem-solving approach

## Naming Convention

```
DER-NNN-[era-name].md
```

- **NNN** — Three-digit number matching the major version (001 = v1, 005 = v5)
- **era-name** — A memorable name capturing the essence of that version

## Current Eras

| DER | Version | Era Name | Period | Status |
|-----|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| [DER-005](DER-005-convergence.md) | v5.0 | Convergence | 2024–Present | Active |
